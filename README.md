CiviCRM Data Integration
========================

This is a Pentaho Data Integration plugin for CiviCRM. It allows you to take advantage
of the power of Pentaho Data Integration tools and use it with your CiviCRM instance.

It uses the CiviCRM API version 3, so you don't have to work directly with the data
tables. :-D

Coming Soon!
------------

We are working hard to be able to publish soon a first alpha release. We hope we'll
publish it here in a few weeks (beggining of november, maybe).
