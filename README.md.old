CiviCRM Data Integration
========================

This is a Pentaho Data Integration plugin for CiviCRM. It allows you to take advantage
of the power of Pentaho Data Integration tools and use it with your CiviCRM instance.

It uses the CiviCRM API version 3, so you don't have to work directly with the data
tables. :-D

We recommend PDI version 4.3 or higher. You can download Pentaho Data Integration here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/
